Lately, i made some python friendly beginner challenge game, which in the end of it, well of course - you will receive a flag! Just relax, and dont get too mad while playing it. This is a beginner one, don't be hard with yourself, good luck.


# Information
your agency has suffered from a DDos attack, in which made services to shut down temporarily.
with luck, the IR team managed to respond quickly, so they gathered information about the attack, blocked the incomming traffics and put services back on air.
one problem - some passwords leaked out, and now you must identify again with your secret code, good luck.
